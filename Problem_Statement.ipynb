These together create a gravitational potential of the galaxy in which the stars revolve. However, observed stellar revolution rates are in stark disagreement with calculated values. This discrepancy can be attributed to the presence of dark matter halo around the galaxy, which creates a potential that fits with the observed velocities.\n",
